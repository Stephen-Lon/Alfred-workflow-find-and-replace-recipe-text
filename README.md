# Alfred-workflow-find-and-replace-recipe-text
Replace tablespoons and teaspoons!

This ridiculously simple workflow acts as a Universal Action on selected text. It is designed to work with recipe text and replaces:
- `tbsps` with `tablespoons`;
- `tbsp` with `tablespoon`;
- `tsps` with `teaspoons`; and
- `tsp` with `teaspoon`.

The result is pasted to the frontmost app (i.e., the app in which you have selected the original text).
